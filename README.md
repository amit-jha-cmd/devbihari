I'm a __motivated__ full stack developer who is passionate to build quality products to help users engage with platforms/applications seamlessly. Apart from being a __Full Stack Developer__ I'm also a __Machine Learning Practitioner__. My main focus in machine learning is to build deployable machine learning solutions to interesting problems which can be deployed as a __Docker Container__.

I'm currently working on several projects one of which is to improve student interaction with schools/colleges and enriching their knowledge with quality content.

Additionally, I'm also spending as much time possible on enhancing my skills around __Django Advanced Concepts__ such as __Django Connect__, __Authentication Protocols__, __Dockerization of machine learning models__. Lastly, I'm spending learning advanced machine learning concepts such as __GANs, NLP, RL etc__.

## Personal Projects

### NeetQuiz: Full Stack Project
```Under Development``` ```React-Native``` ```Django``` ```postgres``` ```aws```

Students preparing for neet often struggle to practice biology questions which are often memory based and need key insights. __NeetQuiz__ is the solution for exactly this problem. It is an application developed using React-Native and Django that can be used by students as minimal cost to better prepare for NEET Examination. You can access the frontend application by [clicking here](https://github.com/devbihari/NeetQuizApp)

__Note: This app is under development and will be available on the play store on 25 August.__

### Sign-Language-Translation : Deep Learning Based Project
```PyTorch``` ```numpy``` ```Pandas```

A Deep Learning solution to detect Indian-Sign-Language from videos. In order to build this solution I collected my own video dataset of India Sign Language. Further I built a LSTM based model that can help detect the signs from video sequences with an accuracy of 64%.

<!-- ### DashAI
```PyTorch``` ```React``` ```Electron``` ```Flask``` ```FastAI``` ```Captum``` -->


### Productivity Tracker: Full-Stack Project
```Electron``` ```React``` ```Nodejs``` ```Mongodb```

A unique solution to track the productivity of employees working from home. This unique application can track number of key strokes, the time spent on the application that is running any project that the employee is working on and whether the employee is actually working on the project based upon the analysis of keystrokes, mouse movements and whether the active window in the computer is for the project or not all while __making sure that the privacy of the employee is not violated__

## Ambition Project
### Gloo
This app is going to redefine how we read books online. More details coming soon.
